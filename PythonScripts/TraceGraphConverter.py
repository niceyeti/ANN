"""
This is for using synthetic data from my process mining thesis project to test a adjacency-matrix based autoencoder design.

The data in the process mining project consists of collections of graphs, one per each trace generated from a process model (a graph).
The input files are stored off for other purposes in "traceGraph.py" files as adjacency-matrices (one per trace), as edge lists: 

	...
	(1,[('3', 'l'), ('l', 'E'), ('E', 'U'), ('U', 'a'), ('a', 'A')])
	....
	
This will be converted to output like:
	1,0000001010000000100000001000001010100000...
	
Tuples of the form tup[0]=trace-id, and tup[1]=adjacency list.

This conversion script converts traceGraph.py files to a binary string to serve as input to an autoencoder.
An adjacency matrix is size |vertices|**2. The rows of this matrix are concatenated into a single multi-hot vector 
of '1' and '0' characters as input to an autoencoder of some form.

Note the similarity of this input to NIST data... its worth thinking about problem similarity and decomposition.
